**Welcome to my Cyber Projects Repository!**

This repository is a collection of my personal cybersecurity projects, experiments, and explorations. I'm passionate about all things cyber and love to tinker with new tools and techniques. Here you'll find a variety of projects, including:

**Ransomware**: This, along with its decryption file, is a Python ransomware script that can be run on a Linux system.
**Keylogger**: This is a keylogger script that can be run on a system and the attacker can monitor keystrokes that the victim does.
**Port Scanner**: This port scanner is written in Python and scans TCP ports on a given target. 
**Disclaimer:**

The projects in this repository are for educational and research purposes only. I do not condone any illegal or unethical activity. Please use these projects responsibly and at your own risk.

**Contributing:**

I'm always open to feedback and contributions. If you find any errors or have suggestions for improvement, please feel free to submit an issue or pull request.
